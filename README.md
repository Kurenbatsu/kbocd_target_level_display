A light weight addon which allows you to display the targets level over its unit frame.

You can scale the frame and adjust its position on screen.

Note: The inspiration to make this addon was the discontinuation of WeakAuras (and certain older addons that are not updated for WoW 12.0 or above). 

I'm OCD with my layouts, hence the naming of this addon.

I'm personally used to playing with the target (and player) frame in the 'classic' locaton; in the top left corner of the screen.

I always found it hard to see the targets level at a glance, so I tried to mirror how the targets level used to be displayed.

I figure there may be more players out there that feel the same. so if you're one of those people, enjoy! - KurenBatsu
